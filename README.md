# Machine Learning Course Repository

## Course Overview
This repository showcases my work from a comprehensive **Machine Learning** course. Throughout the course, I explored fundamental and advanced machine learning concepts through **5 hands-on projects**, implemented in **Python**.

Machine learning is one of the most exciting and impactful fields in technology today. Personally, I find this domain deeply fascinating, and it has become one of my strongest areas of interest. Through these projects, I gained a deeper understanding of machine learning principles, algorithms, and their real-world applications.

## Projects
The repository includes the following projects, each covering a different aspect of machine learning:

1. **Clustering with K-Means**
   - Explored **unsupervised learning** techniques with K-Means clustering to segment data into meaningful groups.

2. **Decision Trees**
   - Implemented and visualized **Decision Trees** for classification tasks, including model evaluation and parameter tuning.

3. **Linear Regression**
   - Built regression models to predict continuous variables, analyzed performance metrics, and optimized results.

4. **Logistic Regression with Bayes and Expectation-Maximization (EM)**
   - Applied **logistic regression** for classification and incorporated probabilistic methods like **Bayesian Inference** and **EM algorithms**.

5. **MAP Classifier**
   - Developed a **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Classifier** for classification problems, combining prior knowledge with observed data.

## Personal Reflection
This course has solidified my passion for **Machine Learning**. I find the ability to teach machines how to make predictions, recognize patterns, and analyze data to be incredibly powerful. It is a field that combines mathematical rigor, creativity, and practical problem-solving—all aspects that inspire me the most.

As I continue to explore and deepen my understanding, I aim to leverage machine learning to solve impactful problems and contribute to real-world innovations.
